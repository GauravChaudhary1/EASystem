Analysis on the following questions:

1. How many employees came today?
	First, operation readEmployees() is performed to read the employee id from the input file.
	This operation builds a Binary Tree using 2 methods, addNode and increaseCount. If a node already
	exists in tree, frequency is increased by 1 else a new node is added.
	
	Complexity for n Inputs: O(n)

2. Did a particular employee come today?
	This operation uses searching(Binary) of Binary Tree with a time complexity of O(log n).

3. How often did an employee enter into the office?
	This operation uses Binary Search of the Tree and then returning the Calculated Frequency with the
	time complexity of O(log n).
		
4. Which employee moves out of office most number of times?
	This operation uses traversing through the weighted binary tree and returing the node with highest
	frequency. Traversal used is pre-order traversal.
	
	Complexity for n inputs: O(n)
	
5. Who all came within a range of IDs, and how often they entered?
	This operation uses traversing through the weighted binary tree and returing the nodes in range with
	frequency. Traversal used is pre-order traversal.
	
	Complexity for n inputs: O(n)
